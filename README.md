🎮 CodeQuest: Learn DSA Through Gaming

CodeQuest is an innovative, interactive platform designed to make learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) engaging and fun. We transform complex theoretical concepts into interactive, game-like challenges, providing real-time feedback and a clear path to mastering fundamental computer science principles.

 Features

CodeQuest is built to provide a structured, gamified learning experience:

Gamified Learning Paths: Progress through structured levels and quests that introduce DSA concepts incrementally.

Interactive Challenges: Solve problems directly in an embedded code editor with support for multiple languages.

Real-time Feedback: Instantly verify your solutions against comprehensive test cases.

DSA Topic Coverage: Covers essential topics including Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, and Dynamic Programming.

Progress Tracking: Monitor your mastery, view achievements, and see where you rank among other learners.

Responsive Design: Learn anytime, anywhere, on desktop or mobile devices.

💻 Tech Stack

While the full stack is known only to the developers, the application, being hosted on Vercel, likely utilizes a modern web development toolkit:

Frontend: React / Next.js (Inferred from Vercel hosting)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (For rapid, utility-first styling)

Deployment: Vercel
